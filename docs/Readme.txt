Background:

We expect the job to take 5-10 hours and the contract will be started in batches between March 1 2024 and April 15 2024. You have one week to complete the job after you receive job instructions. Cloud provider experience is not required for this job.

We are looking for DevOps and developers experienced with shell-based Linux administration, managing Python/MySQL environments, RESTful API development, and virtualization experience. Freelancers will perform various tasks involving these skills on public clouds (prior experience not required).

The intent of this job is as a User Experience (UX) study involving deployment of a LAMP (Python) RESTful API to both virtual server and serverless environments in public clouds. You'll setup a LAMP virtual server using the cloud provider web portal and SSH initially, and later migrate the API to a serverless environment with a managed database. The requirements are well defined and structured. You'll work through a series of tasks guided by an automated browser based script. However, we are available via Upwork Messages should you have any questions or issues during the job.

Process:

1. You accept the job offer and complete the Upwork compliance validation steps.

2. We will provide a URL to a web-based survey introducing you to the job and guiding you through each job task.

3. You will access the web-based survey and enter your Upwork ID (from your profile - for example ~1234abcde789) to start the job.

4. You will be provided with a cloud account credentials to be used for throughout this job.

5. You will follow the job instructions in the survey and complete the tasks in the exact order prescribed. You are encouraged to contact us promptly using Upwork Messages if you have questions or problems.

6. You can work at your own pace and spread the tasks over multiple days, but when you get the job instructions, you have one week to complete that. We estimate the job will take between 5-10 working hours. Please contact us if you need an extension for special circumstances.

7. You will notify us when you have completed the job.

8. We will end the job and provide feedback.

IMPORTANT: The purpose of this job is a UX experiment which depends on proper use of Upwork's time tracker (a.k.a. Work Diary). For this reason, MANUAL TIME IS NOT PERMITTED and should not be logged without prior approva
